# BlogApp
Bloggerz is a full-featured blog application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). Users can register, login, create, read, update, and delete posts. Additionally, users can like and unlike posts. The application uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication and authorization.
